- Convension:
	- _ notation
	- i_ and o_ in front of inputs and outputs
	- rising_edge instead of 'event =
	- Use AXI-Stream convention for communicating between modules.
		- data, valid, ready
		- data could be any composite type (record or array)
		- Example:
			i_sorted_symbols       : in  t_sorted_symbols
			i_sorted_symbols_valid : in  std_logic
			i_sorted_symbols_ready : out std_logic
	- Reset
		- negative
			- in_ and n_ as prefixes.
		- Use reset only when realy needed.
			- That means reset stuff which impact on valid and ready signals, 
				so we don't send garbage to the output.
		- Asynchronous assertion, synchronous deassertion
			- External async reset is applied to async reset of two 
				syncrhonization flip-flops which propagate 1 which is further
				appied to async reset of system flip-flops.
		- Localized reset
			- Use small amount of logic on one synchronized reset.
			- Small fan-out and small delay.
			

- Verification:
	- Transaction level verification
	- Check bit-exact data between pipe modules.
		- For AXIS that means when valid && ready
	- Common file format.
		- CSV
		- char per bit
		- : as separator between fields
	- One file per bus between modules.
