- Use AXI-Stream convention for communicating between modules.
	- data, valid, ready
	- data could be any composite type (record or array)
	- Maybe to pack these 3 signals to struct.

- Verification:
	- Transaction level verification
	- Check bit-exact data between pipe modules.
		- For AXIS that means when valid && ready
	- Common file format.
		- CSV
		- char per bit
		- : as separator between fields
	- One file per bus between modules.
