- Rewrite stuff from work.txt to LaTeX
- Should reset be syncrhonized per module?
- Find out how read from file to std_logic and std_logic_vector to know 
	which separators to use in CSV files.
- Make convention how to read test vectors from CSV files.

- sym_width = 8, block_len_log2 = 7	and max_dep = 9 not working.

- Should we in code_t compare just by length? Maybe hardware could be cheaper
	not to force 0 on unused bits ie. bits above code length.

- Should make two binary_operator child, with print() virtual:
	binary_binary_operator and text_binary_operator.
	- binary_binary_operator should ignore endl().
